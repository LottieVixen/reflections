When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
You would want to use a remote repository for backup as well as having multiple people work on a project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Otherwise something you pull might cause issues with what you are currently working on

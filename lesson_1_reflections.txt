How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

    It allowed me to ignore everything else and focus on just what was changed.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better programmer in the long term?

    You could see things that a frequently changed and take the shorter way in future.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
    
    Forgetting to save is a con, as for pros you chose when to save and won't have non-working code.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because sometimes code is linked where as google docs only has files that usually aren't linked

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    git log to get commits and then git diff to compare different versions of the file

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    
    You can easily revert to an older version if need be so breaking something isn't a big deal.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
